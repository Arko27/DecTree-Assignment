# DecTree-Assignment

For a given dataset of people with gender, age and genre of music that they prefer to listen to, I have trained a ML model using Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm. So that when a new person with a specific age and gender inputs his/her data, my model will be able to predict what genre of music he/she will most likely prefer.

The dataset is given in the csv format.

0 represents female and 1 represents male.
